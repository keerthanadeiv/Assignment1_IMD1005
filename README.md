For this assignment, I honestly ended up feeling more confident doing it than I had expected. I don't have any prior coding experience, so I was definitely intially nervous. However, as I started actually doing it it got less overwhelming lol. I love horses they're one of my favourite animals so I decided to do a little simple informatic website around them. I had a lot of fun with picking a color palette, as well as generally doing the research for this project, both for the horses, and how to use HTML/CSS. I noticed my footer in my "gallery" page is not aligned the same as it is in the other 2, and I can't seem to find the error. Either way, once I got the hang of it I found myself enjoying the process more. Thank you so much for the extension by the wayyyy :)))
